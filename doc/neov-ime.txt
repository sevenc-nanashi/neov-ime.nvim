INTRODUCTION					*neov-ime-intro*

Neovim side implementation for Neovide's IME support.
>
	[ /!\ WARNING ]
	This plugin only works with Neovide with IME support enabled.
	As of now, IME support is not available in stable releases of Neovide.
	You need to build Neovide from source patch in this PR:
	https://github.com/fredizzimo/neovide/pull/2

INSTALLATION					*neov-ime-installation*

Use your favorite plugin manager to install neovime.nvim.
For example, using 'jetpack.vim':
>vim
	call jetpack#add('sevenc-nanashi/neov-ime.nvim')
<

HIGHLIGHTING					*neov-ime-highlighting*

*NeovImePreedit* (-> |Pmenu|):
  The background for preedit text.
*NeovImePreeditCursor* (-> |PmenuSel|):
  The color for following 2 highlights:
*NeovImePreeditCursorOnText* (-> |NeovImePreeditCursor|):
  The part of preedit text under the cursor.
*NeovImePreeditCursorTail* (-> |NeovImePreeditCursor|):
  The cursor at the end of preedit text.

CONFIGURATION					*neov-ime-configuration*

You can prevent the plugin from installing IME handlers automatically by
setting the global variable *g:neovime_manual_setup* to a truthy value before
loading the plugin.
In that case, you need to call the setup function manually:
>lua
	require('neov-ime').setup()
<
Or more verbosely:
>lua
	local neovime = require('neov-ime')
	neovide.preedit_handler = neovime.preedit_handler
	neovide.commit_handler = neovime.commit_handler

TROUBLESHOOTING					*neov-ime-troubleshooting*

If you're getting this message:
>
	[neov-ime] `g:neovide` was set, but Neovide API is still not available. Aborting IME handler installation. Check :h neov-ime-troubleshooting for details.
<
It means that the plugin couldn't access Neovide's API even though `g:neovide`
was set.
I believe this will not happen in normal situations, but if it does, you can try
increasing the timeout duration by setting the global variable
*g:neovime_install_timeout* (in seconds) before loading the plugin.
The default value is `10` seconds.
Or, you can disable the automatic installation of IME handlers by setting
|g:neovime_manual_setup| to a truthy value, and call the setup function manually
when you're sure that Neovide's API is available.
